# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines, specifically concerning the use of the `$unwind` stage. The bug causes unexpected results due to an improper use of `$unwind`, which incorrectly processes the joined documents.

## Bug Description
The original aggregation pipeline uses `$lookup` to join two collections and then `$unwind` to deconstruct the resulting array. However, due to an error in the `$unwind` stage, some documents may be processed or not processed correctly, leading to incorrect results.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates the correct way to use `$unwind`, providing a more precise and accurate way to process the data in the pipeline. This ensures the expected results are obtained, avoiding any data loss or incorrect data representation.
